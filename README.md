A Game for Kings 
AND COMPUTING STUDENTS

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND MARKING SCHEME

 
Overview of the Introduction to AI CAs 
The Introduction to AI continuous assessments covers all learning outcomes as defined in the Module descriptor: 
1.	Describe the theory and concepts underpinning Artificial Intelligence. 
2.	Outline the historical evolution of AI 
3.	Illustrate the architecture of intelligent agents. 
4.	Develop the technical and practical skills for developing algorithms used in game playing 
5.	Demonstrate the use of the structures for knowledge representation and logical reasoning systems. 

The CA is dived in two parts with separate submissions as defined in Table 1 below. It can be seen that there are four components that make up the continuous assessment for the module. Both practical Part 1 and 2 have accompanying practical manuals to guide you through the process and should be followed.

 Table 1: Continuous Assessment schedule for the AI module 
 
Students are required to follow the code supplied on Moodle and through the practical manuals. If a student does not follow the supplied code an award of zero will be awarded. The submissions for 
Part 1 and 2 of the projects are examined through a Moodle submission and a mini viva defense by each student of the work submitted as identified in Table 1 above. If a student does not attend the viva defence of their submitted work a mark of zero will be awarded.

Practical 1 requires you to create the architecture of the Chess game. A player will win the game if they can successfully capture the opponents King. 

Practical 2 is involved with modifying and extending existing structures for knowledge representation to develop your technical and practical skills for developing algorithms used in game playing. To complete this CA you are required to create suitable Intelligent Software Agents and integrate these into your environment.
